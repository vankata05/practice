When reviewing the specs for 3D printers, 
you might encounter the term “CoreXY”. 
What is a “CoreXY” system?

The term refers to a particular design for the X and Y motion systems
on not only 3D printers but also other types of CNC machines. 

The motion system is a critical component of 3D printers, 
particularly filament-based cartesian designs where the hot end must be moved rapidly in three dimensions. 
While the Z-axis is a separate matter, 
the X and Y axis motion systems can be more complex and there are multiple methods of doing so. 

Here is a design used by Ultimaker on their machines. 
Other manufacturers use a variety of other schemes.
